# Mazda AuxMod

An effort to recreate the classic AuxMod for Mazda Radios from around 2000-2007 using code & PCB designs from NikoSapi's MazdaSpoof. 

Currently supports iPod controls from NikoSapi's design, and an Aux input. (CURRENTLY UNTESTED)

- NikoSapi's MazdaSpoof: [nikosapi.org](https://nikosapi.org/w/index.php/MazdaSpoof_-_A_Tape_Deck_Emulator)

## Goals

- Produce something similar to the original AuxMod and NikoSapi's MazdaSpoof. 
- Design a simple connector (using 2 PCBs seperated by standoffs) to allow easy push-fit connection to the Radio with zero modification.

## TODO:

- [ ] Test circuit
- [ ] Design alternate way of connection for plugging into TAPE/MD port on radio
- [ ] Rewrite portions of code
- [ ] Native BlueTooth integration (skipping tracks etc)
